# Showcase Gallery

A mini-website showing images from Geograph Projects. 

Allows users to vote on images (with a basic 1-5 stars) and then creates galleries of high rated images. 

In theory works with multiple Geograph Projects (ie images can be used from any) but 
generally its only been used with Geograph Britain and Ireland, 
not tested with any others. 

Started as sub-project of Geograph.org (the worldwide parent site), but is currently hosted by Geograph Britain and Ireland

The URL is subject to change, but access the live site at https://www.geograph.org/gallery.php
(which will redirect to the current hosting) 

Or https://www.geograph.org/gallery.php?mobile=1 on a mobile device.
